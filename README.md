# H.E.R

> H.E.R recieved runners-up at the annual hackathon hosted by Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology

## A pre-surgery preparations application (C&SE Hackathon 2018)

H.E.R helps the hospital patients by producing generic reminders for tasks that should be completed before a surgery. This tool can be futher improved to produce generic tasks for other use cases (e.g. introducing a new employee to a company, helping people apply for long beurtical processes).

\*The user experience will be most enjoyable on a smartphone.

**How to start the application**:

1. download/clone this repository
2. open downloaded folder
3. open a file called "index.html"

> note: it's advised to use "Google Chrome"

**How to use the application**:

1. enter the date of your "event" (e.g. surgery date)
   .... yup its pretty much that simple
